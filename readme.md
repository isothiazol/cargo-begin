### Cargo Begin

A very simple template project initializer. That's it.

### Usage

```bash
# Installation
cargo install cargo-begin

# Usage
# Can also be `-t`, `--t`, or `-template`:
cargo begin <project name> --template <template>
```

### Notes

The code is probably _really_ bad. I'm still learning rust and made this to learn how to publish crates & get more familiar with file creation stuff.
